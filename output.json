This was one of our goals with this project: to\ncreate a compelling and spectacular interface to draw attention to\nand illustrate a not-so-spectacular reality of contemporary urban\nlife. ",

        "Notes": "D’Ignazio and Klein argue in their book, Data Feminism, that our current practices of data science can lead to the “silencing, extraction, monetization, or invisibility” of people (or other living things) that the data represent [9]. In response to this violence, they assert that we need to make visible those who are creating the data, and those who are represented by the data. In other words, we need to “bring back the bodies.” \n \n \n ",
